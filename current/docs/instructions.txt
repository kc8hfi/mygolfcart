The cart is now stuck in reverse!
swapped out the fwd/rev selector switch, no change

determined that the controller is bad,swapped the black and white
wires around on top of the controller.  these go to the motor and now
the cart will go forward only!
the buzzer still beeps, needs to be unplugged for right now

unhooked the buzzer
left the black and white wires switched so the cart will at least go forward
